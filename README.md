Infrared app for MicroHydra

Can send signals, but scanning is broken.
Also it requires popup_options_2d function, which is not implemented yet.
You can take popup_options_2d from temp.py file and insert it into /lib/mhoverlay.py to test it

Warning: Everything here is in beta, if you got any bugs - welcome to Issues tab

This code can open .ir files, which you can get by exporting [Mi Remote Database](https://github.com/ysard/mi_remote_database) in Flipper format, and saving it in /sd/ir
